## Description

This is a MERN app that utilizes Firebase and Material UI. The purpose of this app is to hold a space for employees to talk freely about their workplace experiences in a forum that isn't affiliated offically with their employer. This can be great for voicing concerns, offering advice, and also building comradery in a world where more and more people are working from home.

## Installation Instructions

You can download all the necessary files into VSCode, run an npm i, and run "npm run start"; or you can simply use the deployed Heroku link.

Sign up and fill out your workplace info; you'll then be assigned to forums for your company and specific location. Make posts and view posts from others.
